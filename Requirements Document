Business Problem: In recent times, there is increase in accidental death rate. It is observed that property documents, insurance documents, bank account information, Will documents, equity and debt information is getting lost as most of these are digital documents stored in some random folders or drive for which the access is limited to deceased member. This is causing severe financial problems and emotional disturbances to the family of deceased

 

Need: Come up with idea on creating a web application that can help the document owner to safely store all documents with shared ownership. Our solution should help the family of deceased to learn about all financial information and reduce the time taken to get the necessary monetary support.

 

Assignment one:

Write down all possible scenarios/user stories on what features the application should cover and what are the assumptions & drawbacks (refer to sample attachment for format).

 

Outcome: A word document with each scenario (use case describing micro level functional feature). This can be at very high level, one line statement type. No need to describe in detail but think beyond google drive application.
